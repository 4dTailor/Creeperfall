# Creeperfall
A minigame about shooting creepers out of the sky!

## How to Play:
Gameplay takes place on a platform in the sky. Creepers with slow falling with peroidically spawn above the platform with slow falling which you can shoot down with your bow and arrow. Be careful, as any Creepers that land on the platform gain inviciblity, so there's no way to prevent them from exploding.

The shop, which can be accessed with the compass, contains armor upgrades and can spawn a guardian or a cat. The guardian will fire a laser at any creepers that get to close to the platform, save for those that have already landed. The cat will kill all Creepers three seconds after spawning in then despawn.
